# Burger Favorites List
<br>

### Summary
Burger list is a simple tool to make a list of burgers, and then have the option to add them to the favorites list.

### The goal of this project
The site was built to demonstrate the use of handlebars to create a functional site instead of creating one simply using HTML. While the user cannot tell this by using the site. Closer examination of the code will show it. 

### File Structure
The page was contructed using handlebars files, instead of .html files. Essentially they are the same, but inherit certain values from other files and therefore can save a programmer time. 

### Instructions
A user can add a burger to the list on the main page, and on the all burgers page, they may add it ot the favorites list. You may also delete the burgers. The whole site is simple and relatively self explanatory.
